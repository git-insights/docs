# Code Line Changes

Although [code changes](code-changes.md) can be a proxy to the coding activity of a project, not all changes are of the same importance. Considering the aggregated number of lines touched in all changes gives a complementary idea of how significant the changes are. The type of a change list \(for example, a new feature or a bug fix\) is also equally crucial for understanding the impact of the coding activity.
