# Time to First Response

The first response to an activity, especially for open-source projects, is sometimes the most critical one. A long time to respond to an activity can be a sign that a community is not responsive. A short time to respond to an activity can help to engage more members into further discussions and within the community. This metric is crucial for the remote teams as well since they depend heavily on asynchronous communication and acknowledgment.
