# Activity Dates and Times

Individuals engage in activities in software projects at various times of the day. This metric is aimed at determining the dates and times of when individual activities were completed. For open-source projects, this data can be used to probabilistically estimate where on earth contributions come from in cases where the time zone is not UTC.
